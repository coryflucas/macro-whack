Macro Whack
===========

A little whack-a-mole style game for the [Adafruit MacroPad](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5128) built with [Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/).

## Install

Copy `code.py` to the root of your `CIRCUITPY` volume.  This requires the `adafruit-macropad` library and its dependencies.  You can install this with [circup](https://learn.adafruit.com/keep-your-circuitpython-libraries-on-devices-up-to-date-with-circup/install-circup):

```
$ circup install adafruit_macropad
```
